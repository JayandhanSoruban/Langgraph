ResearchGPT 
A multi-agent assistant that helps you research any topic and outputs a structured summary.

ðŸ§© Problem Statement
Researching a topic manually takes time â€” you need to break it down, search for reliable information, and summarize it into something understandable. This can be repetitive and inefficient, especially for students, analysts, and knowledge workers.

âœ… Proposed Solution
Build an automated research assistant using LangGraph, where multiple agents collaborate to:

Analyze the topic

Collect relevant information

Summarize the research

This system runs in a structured loop with LangGraph orchestrating the agent flow.
